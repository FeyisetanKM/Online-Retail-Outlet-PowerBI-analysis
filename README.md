# Online-Retail-Outlet-PowerBI-analysis
This repository contains code and documentation for exploring and analyzing a dataset. The goal is to perform data exploration, cleaning, modeling, and analysis to derive meaningful insights.
The dataset was explored to understand its structure, variables, and potential issues. Necessary cleaning was done.
For data modeling, an entity relationship diagram was used to build an appropriate data model, designing an efficient schema that supported analytical queries.
Relevant DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) calculations were implemented to extract insights from the data, including time-based calculations and comparisons to provide deeper analysis.
The analyzed data was visualised to present insights effectively, using appropriate charts, graphs, and visualizations to communicate key findings.
